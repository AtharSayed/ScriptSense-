# 🧠 Personality Prediction from Handwriting ✍️ (Hybrid Deep Learning + Graphology)

This project predicts personality traits from handwriting images using a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and rule-based graphology analysis. It also features a clean and interactive Streamlit web app for easy usage.

## 🔍 What It Does

Given an image of handwriting, the system:

1. 🧠 Predicts the Big Five personality trait using a trained CNN.
2. ✍️ Extracts graphological features like slant, pressure, baseline, etc.
3. 🧪 Infers personality insights using handcrafted rules based on graphology.
4. 🔀 Combines both predictions into a hybrid interpretation.
5. 📊 Displays results with confidence scores and trait-wise insights.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- 🐍 **Python 3.9** – Core programming language
- 🧠 **TensorFlow / Keras** – For CNN model development and inference
- 🖼 **OpenCV** – For image preprocessing and feature extraction
- 🌐 **Streamlit** – Web interface for uploading images and displaying results
- 📊 **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – For trait visualization and embedding plots
